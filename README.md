Hi I'm James!
I'm a bit of a newbie at coding but I like it.
I'm on the lookout for some programmer pals, so reach out to me if you wanna collaborate on something.
I know python pretty well, and also the Kivy framework.
Currently learning Javascript so I can finally get a job and be a real man.
I'm planning to learn java, c++ and the lot, eveeeeeeeeeeeeentually.
All right, you may stop reading this................now.
